Arc x Arctic Apricity inspired gnome-shell theme. Clear, minimal, dark.

* Mist - https://github.com/theRealPadster/Mist-theme
* Arc - https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme
* Arctic Apricity - https://github.com/agajews/ArcticApricity

Complementary:

* Vim Color: Dracula - https://github.com/dracula/vim
* Icons: Vibrancy - `sudo apt-get install vibrancy-colors`

## Original

Inspired by the look of the GDM3 login manager, the goal is to have a theme that is as fully transparent and out-of-the-way as possible. This means a panel that blends right into the desktop, simple flat, transparent buttons, and the bare minimum when it comes to menus and elements that overlap the workspace.
